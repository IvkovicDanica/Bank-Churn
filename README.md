# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for predicting customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and includes a comprehensive set of attributes for each customer, allowing us to analyze and predict customer behavior effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle [Telecom Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). It includes information about:
- Customers who churned within the last month
